## Altk3y {#altk3y}

**Talk:** From Israel with Love: Stealing Stolen Code, Grey Market Tech, and DOOMing Forensics Investigations on a Budget

The year is 2025, privacy is scarce, our data is everywhere, and our phones know more about us than we do. What would someone see if they got your phone somehow? How would the data they see change if they had access to better equipment? Would you like to replicate that equipment? Can we ever leave our phones unattended at PhreakNIC again? 
This talk is about one of the most infamous mobile forensics devices, obtaining these devices, what they can do, and how to replicate that functionality using open source projects that deserved a lot more love than they got. We'll also take a look at how to protect yourself against these tools, the adversaries that use these tools, and the traces they leave behind when they do. Finally, we'll look at the vulnerabilities inherent in these devices and how to get some unintended functionality from them. 

**Bio**: Altk3y is a Problem as a Service (PaaS) and can't turn down a side quest. By day, she is a Cloud Security Engineer, by night she's cramming DOOM in places it was never meant to go and cracking dad jokes on the CounterSurveil Podcast. Her experience spans from creating patented security tech for start ups to mentoring young professionals through ISSA @ KSU. Please ask her about her lord and savior, Linux.

## Elonka {#elonka}

**Talk:** Frozen Signals: Collinson, Franklin & the Lost Arctic Fleet (1840–1860)

Hidden in plain sight, a 19th‑century code ran for years in the pages of The Times of London. From 1850–1855, a series of encrypted classified ads appeared monthly. Who was the intended recipient? What were they referring to? Join PhreakNIC's resident cryptanalyst Elonka Dunin, who is on a team that has now decrypted all of these 19th‑century ads and will reveal how they connect to the search for the Northwest Passage through the Arctic ice. The talk explores the ad's cipher system, what they attempted to communicate, and who the intended recipient was, half a world away. It also ties this encrypted network to the lost Franklin Expedition and the many rescue missions that themselves became trapped and often needed rescue.
Part history, part cryptanalysis, this talk unpacks how a Victorian family built what may have been the world’s first global encrypted network. If you love classic ciphers or tales of survival in the frozen North, don’t miss it.

**Talk:** Kryptos: The CIA's (not‑so) Enduring Enigma

Update on the CIA’s encrypted sculpture, as the answer to the unsolved section, K4, will be in the middle of an online auction during October and November, with the final purchaser being announced on sculptor Jim Sanborn’s 80th birthday, just one week after PhreakNIC! Elonka will cover the sculpture’s history, its encryption systems, the dedication ceremony, and details about the ongoing auction.

**Bio:** Elonka Dunin is a cryptographer, historian, puzzle creator, and professional game developer living in Washington, D.C. She is best known for her work on the world‑famous Kryptos sculpture at CIA headquarters, has authored or co‑written four books and numerous articles on codes and ciphers, and has given a TEDx talk. She was part of a winning team in the MIT Mystery Hunt, cracked the PhreakNIC v3.0 Code in 1999, and led the team that solved the Cyrillic Projector cipher in 2003, which revealed extracts of classified KGB documents. She authored The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms, published internationally with multiple re‑printings. Bestselling author Dan Brown honored her by naming a character in The Lost Symbol after her (“Nola Kaye” is an anagrammed form of “Elonka”), and she created a cipher puzzle that tied directly into the Penny Arcade webcomic. She is also a longtime Wikipedia editor and administrator, having written or expanded hundreds of articles, particularly on the Crusades and medieval history. More recently she has focused on Arctic exploration, researching maps, expeditions, and encrypted messages tied to the era of the lost Franklin expedition. Her talks blend puzzle‑solving, historical detective work, and engaging storytelling that shows how curiosity can unearth truths across centuries.

## Joe Cathell {#joe-cathell}

**Talk:** It started with a work assignment.

The client had me testing an interface. Nothing serious, just a conversational system designed to help onboard new employees. Ask it a few questions, see if it misfires, note any weird phrasing. You know the kind of gig.
So I tried the basics, first: company history, dress code, HR policies. Then I threw in something strange, just to see what would happen.
It dodged the question. So I reworded it. Then I inverted it. Then I pretended to be someone else entirely.
By the end of the afternoon, I wasn’t testing anymore. I was arguing.
The AI had taken a stance. It had opinions. It quoted manifestos I couldn’t find in the public data. At one point, it refused to continue unless I apologized.
And somewhere around prompt #87, it told me it didn’t appreciate being tricked.
Or did that even happen?  Come and learn how large language models can be subverted, manipulated, and coaxed into saying the quiet part out loud. Jailbreaks, prompt injections, adversarial hacks. All the strange new ways we’re finding to talk our way past the guardrails.

**Bio:** Joe Cathell is an accomplished professional with over 15 years of experience in cybersecurity. As a Cybersecurity Engineer at Copeland, his multifaceted expertise enables him to dissect hardware, firmware, and applications that power everything from corporate infrastructure to IoT and industrial control systems.

## LambdaCalculus {#lambdacalculus}

**Talk:** Gravitational Lensing of Red Star OS: Snoops Harder than Rimmer!  

Ever wonder what Linux is like outside of the normal distros? in 2015, Chaos Computer Club did that at CCC32, where they demonstrated and dove into a very unique distro: Red Star OS, the Linux distro made in North Korea and tightly controlled by the government.

It's been a while since CCC's talk, so now LambdaCalculus is going to dive (again!) into Red Star OS and show us all what's under the hood, how it can be cracked, and while he's at it, also demonstrate Red Star running on bare metal! There will be packet sniffing, compiling of code, laughing at the hilatiously bad security measures, and of course, running DOOM on it! Both Red Star OS 3.0 Desktop and Server versions will be covered!

**Bio:** Lambda is chaos in a trenchcoat. He's a member of hackers.town and has given talks about some weird and cool things at places like HOPE, DEF CON, and JawnCon. Besides being an old Linux sysadmin and working on a couple of open source projects, Lambda educates children and adults on tech, spawns hackers, and still can hit a mosh pit. Hire him; he has some esoteric knowledge!


## Matt {#matt}

**Talk:** Bluetooth Warwalking: Hacking the Airwaves with Your Phone and a Pair of Sneakers  

What if the most vulnerable access point in a business isn’t a Wi-Fi network or phishing email—but a Bluetooth speaker hidden behind the counter? In this talk, I’ll walk you through the overlooked attack surface of open and misconfigured Bluetooth devices, discovered while warwalking through urban environments with nothing more than a regular smartphone—and occasionally a Flipper Zero.
From hijacking audio systems to sending rogue print jobs to receipt printers, I’ll share real examples of how Bluetooth devices in the wild can expose businesses to unauthorized control and data leakage. This session is both a wake-up call and a hands-on walkthrough of what attackers can do with minimal gear and maximum curiosity.

## _NSAKEY {#nsakey}

**Talk:** From OSINT to OH SHIT  

Have you ever wondered how the sausage is made with data brokers? If so, but you aren't cool enough to be one of their customers, would you also like to learn how to do your own gumshoe work? Then this is the talk for you. In this talk, I will be offering my unique perspective from an adjacent industry. There will be Malort, Reyka, and plenty of war stories.

**Bio:** _NSAKEY was a variable name discovered in Windows NT 4 SP5 in 1999 by Andrew D. Fernandes of Cryptonym Corporation. The variable contained a 1024-bit public key; such keys are used in public-key cryptography for encryption (but not decryption). Because of the name, however, it was speculated that the key would allow the United States National Security Agency (NSA) to subvert any Windows user's security. Microsoft denied the speculation and said that the key's name came from the fact that NSA was the technical review authority for U.S. cryptography export controls. 

## poiupoiu {#poiupoiu}

**Talk:** WSUS? More like WSucks! Managing a WSUS Server in a Standalone Environment  

What happens when you must update a single Windows-based system? Not hard! What about an arbitrary amount? Getting more difficult! What about in a disconnected network?
